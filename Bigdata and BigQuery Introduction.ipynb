    "<p> Types of Big Data Analytics\n",
    "There are four types:\n",
    "\t1. Descriptive Analytics: It uses data aggregation and data mining to provide insight into the past and answer: “What has happened?” The descriptive analytics does exactly what the name implies they “describe” or summarize raw data and make it interpretable by humans. \n",
    "\t\n",
    "\t                                                                                                                                                               \n",
    "\t2. Predictive Analytics: It uses statistical models and forecasts techniques to understand the future and answer: “What could happen?” Predictive analytics provides companies with actionable insights based on data. It provides estimates about the likelihood of a future outcome. \n",
    "\t\n",
    "\t   \n",
    "\t3. Prescriptive Analytics: It uses optimization and simulation algorithms to advice on possible outcomes and answers: “What should we do?” It allows users to “prescribe” a number of different possible actions and guide them towards a solution. In a nutshell, this analytics is all about providing advice.  \n",
    "\t\n",
    "\t   \n",
    "\t4. Diagnostic Analytics: It is used to determine why something happened in the past. It is characterized by techniques such as drill-down, data discovery, data mining and correlations. Diagnostic analytics takes a deeper look at data to understand the root causes of the events. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Big Data Tools\n",
    "These are some of the following tools used for Big Data Analytics: Hadoop, Pig, Apache HBase, Apache Spark, Talend, Splunk, Apache Hive, Kafka.\n",
    "Big Data Domains\n",
    "\n",
    "From <https://www.edureka.co/blog/big-data-analytics/> \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Here I am going to use Biq Query for the data analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "BigQuery is a fully-managed, serverless data warehouse that enables scalable analysis over petabytes of data. It is a Platform as a Service (PaaS) that supports querying using ANSI SQL. It also has built-in machine learning capabilities. BigQuery was announced in May 2010 and made generally available in November 2011.\n",
    "\n",
    "From <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BigQuery> \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Features[edit]\n",
    "• Managing data - Create and delete objects such as tables, views, and user defined functions. Import data from Google Storage in formats such as CSV, Parquet, Avro or JSON.\n",
    "• Query - Queries are expressed in a standard SQL dialect[4] and the results are returned in JSON with a maximum reply length of approximately 128 MB, or an unlimited size when large query results are enabled.[5]\n",
    "• Integration - BigQuery can be used from Google Apps Script[6] (e.g. as a bound script in Google Docs), or any language that can work with its REST API or client libraries.[7]\n",
    "• Access control - Share datasets with arbitrary individuals, groups, or the world.\n",
    "• Machine learning - Create and execute machine learning models using SQL queries.\n",
